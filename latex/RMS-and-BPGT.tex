\section{Introduction} % (fold)
\label{sec:introduction}

Artificial neural networks are computational models that mimic the architecture, structure and/or functional aspects of biological
neural networks such as the human brain. They are comprised of multiple processing elements called neurons which are interconnected
through links. Often, these links have weights associated to them called synaptic weights. These weights scale the signals received from
different neurons, allowing the network to process patterns and generate an output pattern. The synaptic weights are free parameters
that may be changed, allowing the neural network to change its behavior. In artificial neural networks, neurons are often grouped
together in layers or slabs and a neural network may be composed of 1 or more of these~\cite{skapura}. As an example, a feedforward
neural network is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:figures_ffwdnn}.

The entire behavior of the neural network is determined by the individual behaviors of neurons that comprise it. Each neuron gathers
input from the external environment or other neurons. The neuron then generate a signal that may be input to other neurons or the final
output. This process continues throughout the network until a response is produced on the external environment. Neurons modulate and
aggregate the input to calculate an activation value. The activation value may be the same or it could be a function of the aggregation.
The activation value then is passed as a parameter to an activation function, which determines the output of the neuron (See Figure~\ref{fig:figures_single_neuron}).

Neural networks possess important advantages and capabilities as computational models. Among these include their ability to: solve
problems of nonlinear nature, perform input-output mapping through a learning process, adaptation to new situations, and their inherent
parallelism~\cite{Haykin:1994:NNC:541500}. One of the greatest advantages of using a neural network is that we do not program it with a
configuration to solve a problem. It is actually programmed to learn and adapt to solve a problem. Neural networks have two types of
learning supervised and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning consists in giving a network a set of points and allowing to correct
its prediction by giving it the expected output. Unsupervised learning is often used when the network cannot be provided with a target
output, and therefore works with evolutionary models. We focus on supervised learning for this report.

Even though biological neurons are 6 orders of magnitude slower than the integrated circuits found in today's computer processors. They
work as a massively parallel system allowing efficient solutions to complex problems such as facial recognition. These problems are
still a challenge today for today's artificial neural networks, and other computational models. Artificial neural networks have been
successfully applied in applications such as: Function approximation or regression analysis and Classification, including pattern and
sequence recognition among others.

Our interest in this report is confined to a class of neural networks which emulate the process of learning. This report examines two
different algorithms for training feedforward neural networks. One algorithm is the Back-propagation algorithm and the other is the Root
Mean Square (RMS) Minimization algorithm.

\section{Feedforward Neural Networks} % (fold)
\label{sec:feedforward_neural_networks}

In a feedforward neural network only neurons of adjacent layers are interconnected with synaptic weights. Each layer of the neural
network has connections to the next layer and there are no connections oriented backwards. The feedforward neural network begins with an
input layer which may be connected to a hidden layer or directly to an output layer. The first layer is the input layer. It connects
directly to the external environment and captures the input patterns presented to the network. The last layer is the output layer which
produces the output pattern to the external environment. All other layers are considered hidden and may or may not be present.

The processing of a feedforward neural network begins when an external pattern made is copied to the input layer. The neurons of the
input layer communicate the pattern to the following layers through synapses. The pattern is then received by neurons of non-input
layers and modulated by the weight of their connections. We denote weights as $W_{jk}$, where $j$ is the neighbor neuron, and $k$ is the
neuron . Each neuron receives stimulation from other neurons, except the input layer which captures the pattern. Once the inputs are
modulated, they are integrated and an activation value is determined. Often the activation value is just the integration of the
modulated inputs, but may also be a function $F_{i}(a_{i}(t-1), net_{i}(t))$, where $a_{i}(t-1)$ is the activation at the previous time
step and $net_{i}(t)$ is the integration of modulated inputs. (see Algorithm~\ref{alg:feedforward}
)

	}

\subsection{Data Structure} % (fold)
\label{sub:data_structure}

We do not have to implement neural networks to study them, it is possible to simulate their execution to solve problems in a computer.
We build data structures in order to represent the neural network. A neural network can be thought of as a directed graph, where the
neurons are nodes, and the synaptic weights are the arcs of the graph. Because we focus on feed-forward networks, our graphs can further
be specified as directed acyclic graphs. This graphs do not require a full matrix to represent all possible connections between the
neurons. Instead we use an array of matrices where each matrix stores the synaptic weights of the departing connections from the current neuron in the current layer to the neurons of the next layer (see Figure~\ref{fig:figures_ffwdnn_DS}).

\]

We may also add an additional free parameter that does not link to other neuron, and has a constant input. We call this parameter the bias, and it allows the activation functions to translate along the y-axis. We include the bias as one more row of elements for each matrix that represents connections between neurons (see Figure~\ref{fig:}).

\caption{The Back-propagation Algorithm }
\label{alg:feedforward}
\end{algorithm}

Back-propagation is a method of supervised learning. It is used to train our feedforward neural network. To use the back-propagation
algorithm we provide it with both example inputs and target outputs. The outputs generated by the neural network are then compared
against the target outputs of the given example. Using the target outputs, the back-propagation training algorithm then calculates error
and adjusts the weights of the various layers backwards from the output layer to the input layer.

Back-propagation is often used to train feedforward neural networks; however it can be used to train other types of networks, and
likewise feedforward networks may be trained with other methods. In this report, we only examine the case where back-propagation is used to train a feedforward neural network.

\subsection{Time Complexity} % (fold)
\label{sub:time_complexity}

To determine the number of operations performed in each epoch of the learning algorithm we count the weights between the layers of the
neural network. To do this we consider that the number of weights between two layers of neurons is the product of the number of neurons
of each layer. Therefore the total number of weights for the entire network is $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}N_{i}N_{i+1}$ where $N_{i}$ is the
number of neurons in each layer, and $n$ is the total number of layers. For the back-propagation algorithm we obtained that the number
of operations in a single epoch depends on the number of weights and bias. Therefore it has linear complexity $O(n)$ with respect to the
number of neurons. In the RMS algorithm the number of operations in a single epoch of the RMS algorithm is squared because we run the
feedforward algorithm for each change we do on a single weight.

\section{Conclusion} % (fold)
\label{sec:conclusion}

The Backpropagation algorithm has time complexity within $O(n)$, which is faster than the RMS Minimization algorithm with a time
complexity of $O(n^{2})$ when varying the number of neurons in the middle layer. 

The Backpropagation algorithm reached a smaller error for the simple examples that the RMS Minimization algorithm.

As observed in some results, the neural network may get stuck in local minima unable to arrive to better solutions. We noticed this in
both the Backpropagation and RMS Minimization algorithms.
